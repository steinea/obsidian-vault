It's presentation day @CGSAACEV! I'll be sharing my paper, "Beasts and Sovereigns," on Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring, during the Video Game Flora and Fauna panel, happening now at #CGSA2023

Some great conversations about animals and video games with my co-panelists @sarah_stang and Stuart Gritter, ranging across Stray, Untitled Goose Game, Factorio, Elden Ring, and more.

Excellent, thoughtful, charitable questions from attendees made this panel a true privilege to be a part of. Getting to use phrases like "I have no plans of turning into a cosmic space slug anytime soon" is always a joy.

Many thanks to @ahbraithwaite for chairing and facilitating this wonderful discussion.
