As promised, the full paper that I presented at #ICGaN2023 is now available open access on Zenodo.

If you enjoy this and want to hear me talk more about Elden Ring, I'm presenting another paper at #CGSA2023 next month: "Beasts and Sovereigns: The Zoopolitical Imagination of FromSoftware's Demon's Souls, Bloodborne, and Elden Ring."
