My review of @Gua_Le_Ni and @doktorplirtz's fascinating book, Fictional Games: A Philosophy of Worldbuilding and Imaginary Play, went live on @AncillaryReview today.

If this book sounds of interest, I would match it with Cameron Kunzelman's The World Is Born From Zero, reviewed for ARB here ...

... and with Patrick Jagoda's Experimental Games, also reviewed for ARB.

A productive theoretical triangulation: play, speculation, and the powers of fiction—whether interactive or otherwise.

> @Gua_Le_Ni: Many thanks for the thoughtful and sharp review, Eric. Glad you also noticed parallels and overlaps with the work of @ckunzelman (alas, his book came out when we were already done with production for Fictional Games) :)

@Gua_Le_Ni @doktorplirtz @AncillaryReview @ckunzelman I had assumed as much from the dates, but I found the parallels striking!
