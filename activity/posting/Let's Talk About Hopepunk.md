> when i wrote this i was mostly annoyed but still high on the fact that my work was featured in a major outlet but the fact is: a cis+white USian misused my words (& my art) to promote something i'm firmly against, to thousands of readers this is absurdly dishonest and i'm tired

@wen_di_yu This sucks, Wendi. I'm sorry this happened. I'm sorry you were treated in such a dishonest way. I'm sorry that your work wasn't featured the way it deserves.

Let's talk about hopepunk ðŸ§µ

Jo drew my attention to the Polygon article last week, and I just read it today. Was off Twitter for most of the weekend, so I'm catching up on what Wendi, Gabriel, and others have had to say about it. Disappointing, to say the least.

> The opposite of grimdark is hopepunk, and tabletop RPGs are leading the way forward to a more optimistic future for the hobby â€” and humanity. https://www.polygon.com/tabletop-games/23711055/hopepunk-ttrpg-games

As one of the hosts of the #AppliedHope jam back in 2021, I feel a responsibility to these wonderful ttrpg designers who have been misrepresented, "forcibly assigned hopepunk" as a designator for their work.

Before reading any more from me, please read Wendi Yu's original thread.

> ok, so, first of all: i loathe the word hopepunk and everything related to it, and my work is clearly NOT that and it's weird that nobody told me they'd bundle Marvelous Mutations & Merry Musicians under that label that said, HOLY SHIT I'M IN A POLYGON ARTICLE???

This article Wendi links is essential, and enlightened me to some context around the term "hopepunk" of which I was not previously aware.

Gabriel Caetano, another great designer who contributed to Applied Hope, adds their voice here.

> I second the sentiment. I did not mind the use of the term hopepunk before but now that I am aware of what it stands for and what it means, I want to make clear that I don't stand by it and I don't want my name or work to be associated with it.

And this thread from Indi Tan situates hopepunk in ttrpgs in a broader context of DnD and YA influencer scenes.

> So Polygon told the creators featured in this article that this article would discuss their games. They did NOT tell them that they would under the 'hopepunk' label, which Polygon has apparently just discovered and has been a source of negative discourse for years.

When Jo spun up the Applied Hope jam and invited me to co-host it with him, neither of us had any intention of capitalizing on a movement, consolidating a genre, or building a platform. We just wanted to jam, to bring together a bunch of cool people and make some games.

I could not believe the outpouring of creativity in response to our call for submissions. I wrote about every entry in this long threadâ€”please click through and check them out.

It was a vibrant community. We had some really thoughtful discussions about the limits of solarpunk, about game design beyond the forces of empire, settler-colonialism, and industrial capitalism, and about game design that actively subverts these forces.

Importantly, in the theme list that Jo wrote, hopepunk is just one in a myriad of options, one small jumping off point amongst a plurality of others. We began from a place of critical multiplicity, contra apparatuses of capture that enforce homogeneity and acceptability.

Punk is a demand for "something else," a world radically otherwise, an "uncommon commons." In this way, punk is always already hopeful, and has never needed to be commodified and corporatized to be so. Punk refuses such impulses.

> ok but this comment just reminded me of JosÃ© Esteban MuÃ±oz's work about punk and/as hope/utopia and i really think some people would really benefit from reading it :) excerpts from Gimme Gimme Thisâ€¦ Gimme Gimme That, 2013, and Cruising Utopia, 2019

There is no hopepunk. There are only people and their actions, how they choose to use whatever power and position they are given. If we allow real struggle and contention to be hope-washed away by the interests of corporations and influencers, we all lose, and punk dies.

The participants in the Applied Hope jam were generous, talented, insightful, compassionateâ€”and not a one was interested in propping up a corporate marketing gimmick. Many of them are still doing excellent work, and deserve better from big outlets like Polygon.

Based on the original interview pitch, I want to believe that the author, though naive, had good intentions, that they were genuinely excited by the works they featured, that they were moved to envision a different set of possibilities for ttrpgs.

> i'm still annoyed at this so i went back to check my emails to see if i missed something the interview's pitch was: "tabletop games that buck the post-apocalypse trend & explore possible futures with creativity, joyÂ & care at their core" no mention of hopepunk

I don't want them to stop writing. I want them to think deeply about their power and position, about the forces they invoke when they put words to page, and about the commitments they make when they invite others into that process.

@Polygon: I really appreciate that you have been trying to provide coverage of the indie ttrpg scene. But when it comes to indie creators and their work, you need to go the distance with what you publish.

> Are you at all going to respond to this, or are you going to make it clear to future PoC in TTRPGs that youâ€™ll twist their words and present them out of context by your white writers?

If we don't take care in this wayâ€”and here, especially, I speak from my own position as a white settler to other such peopleâ€”we will ultimately only serve to replicate the systems of violence and extraction that we otherwise hope to defeat in the world at large.
