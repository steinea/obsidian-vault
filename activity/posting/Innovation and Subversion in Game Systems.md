Today was presentation day! Thrilled to have the chance to talk about Elden Ring at #ICGan2023 alongside @jasonaboyd and @PobudaTanya on Signs of the Sojourner, and Josiah Boucher on Hades, Dark Souls, and Twelve Minutes.

Our panel, "Endless Possibilities: Innovation and Subversion in Game Systems" was interested in how the games in question use their mechanics and systems in narratively innovative ways.

An interesting point of agreement that emerged between us during Q&A was a disinterest in relitigating the narratology vs. ludology or ludonarrative dissonance debates, and instead looking at games that understand that systems and stories are always already mutually constitutive.

My paper, "Tactile Thematics: Passages of Plurality in FromSoftware's Elden Ring," was a chance for me to return to my first ever paper on FromSoftware's games from 2020 and extend that analysis to Elden Ring by looking at physicalized narrative elements throughout the game.

My big claim: FromSoft games "are not only entertainment objects but rhetorical devices that involve their players in ruptures of in-game worldviews, using their mechanics to ... refigure what it means to be a subject."

In Elden Ring, memory stones, talismans, items, and spells—and the systems around them—are designed in such a way as to externalize player-character capacities, shifting away from interactions determined by intrinsic power and toward extrinsic skill.

I should have the full paper up on Zenodo and on my website in the next day or so. For now, if you want to read the first paper from a few years back (Tactile Thematics pt. 1), you can find the pdf here.
