Eric Stein is a graduate student in the MA Interdisciplinary Humanities program at TWU, concentrating in English Literature. His research is concerned with the ethico-political implications of language, and the mythic resonances of such in Frank Herbert's science-fiction classic *Dune*. He has written on pop culture, television, and semiotic theory for *Mars Hill*, and is currently working on a book-length collection of poetry.
