A surnames registry is an index of names intended to collect all ancestors with a given [[Surname|family name]] in a straightforward, unified view, allowing for the tracing of direct lineages by said names. A surnames registry also has the benefit of making visible less prominent names in the ancestor table, surfacing those individuals that might otherwise go unnoticed. More generally, a surnames registry provides an opportunity for exploring the cultural and historical context of a given family name, which can help situate a specific root in their broader genealogical context.

The surnames registry on this site allows for research that goes beyond the familial record, making connections and providing context where gaps in the genealogy appear.
