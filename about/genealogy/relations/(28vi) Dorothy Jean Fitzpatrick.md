#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]].*

Dorothy Jean was born October 11th, 1908, in Saint John, New Brunswick, the fourth daughter of [[(28) John Thomas Fitzpatrick]] and [[(29) Mary Elizabeth Bowland]].

I know nothing of her childhood except to say that brother [[(28v) Gordon William Fitzpatrick]] and Dorothy had a special bond that continued throughout their lives. When her parents and brother [[(28vii) John Harold Fitzpatrick]] and sister [[(28viii) Audrey Heloise Fitzpatrick]] traveled west in 1923, to visit the rest of the family in Calgary, Alberta, Dorothy remained in Saint John with her aunt [[(58vi) Annie Maud Bowland]], Mary’s sister.

As it turned out, she would not see her mother again. Mary became ill while living in Calgary and died in 1924. At this time, Dorothy was fifteen years old. Her brother Harold, age eleven, stayed in Calgary to be raised by sister [[(28i) Jessie Maitland Fitzpatrick]], and Audrey, age nine, lived initially with sister [[(28ii) Annie Catherine Fitzpatrick]] until arrangements were made for her to return to Saint John and Aunt Maud raised her. Her father returned to Boston, Massachusetts in the United States, where his mother and some siblings were living.

Dorothy continued to live with Aunt Maud and gave her a lot of grief through her teenage years. She married Robert Watson, however, the marriage ended in divorce.

Her second marriage was to Gordon Nelson and they lived in Belmont, Mass. with a cottage in Cape Cod. Dorothy was the only one of her family who never traveled west although her older siblings did visit her in Belmont, where she became an American citizen June 2nd, 1941.

Her brother Gordon and his wife Ann loved to visit Gordon and Dorothy and as they grew older, they kept in touch on the phone.

Dorothy knew she had a large family in Canada and her friend and lawyer Frank H. Handy, Jr. told us that she was always proud of her New Brunswick Fitzpatrick heritage. We were all contacted when her will was probated, which for me highlighted the fact that I really did have an Aunt Dorothy. However, it was stated in her will, “I hereby make no provision for any other relatives of mine.” A nice sentence in the letter from the lawyer, “She missed Gordon a great deal but kept her quick wit and gentle ways to the end.”

She died April 22nd, 1984, and is buried in the Belmont Cemetery, Belmont, Massachusetts.
