#### Biography

*Written by [[(6) Albert Kirkham]]’s wife [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after [[(12i) Clara Mary Kirkham]]’s death when Bert and Dick corresponded.*

Richard was the only child born to Richard Kirkham and Jane Mallen in England July 3, 1912.  Richard was born on his parents first wedding anniversary day.

When Richard was an infant, his parents made the decision to emigrate to Canada with his Grandfather Kirkham, Uncle Alfred and Aunt Lilian.  They sailed on the SS Andania from Southampton, England on August 21st, 1913 arriving in Quebec on August 30th, 1913.  Richard was only fourteen months old.  Although he was born in England, he was very much a Canadian growing up in Nanaimo, B. C.

His father Richard passed away in 1922 when little Richard was only ten years old.  For awhile, Richard and his mother were on their own until his mother met and married Alex Fowler.  

When Richard was sixteen years old, he went to work as a Bell Hop at the Hotel Windsor.  This was the same hotel that his Grandfather Kirkham worked at as a clerk in charge of the registration desk.

For his sixteenth birthday his Auntie Elsie, Uncle Alfred’s wife, gave him a black and amber gold tip cigarette holder.  At age 89, he still has it although he no longer smokes.

Richard went to England with his mother and Alex in 1933.  There he worked for Bean Industries, known as Bean Cars, before World War I.  He ran the big lathe turning out joints for Iraq Pipeline which stretched across the desert to a boat harbour where oil tankers were loaded.  In 1935, they returned to Vancouver Island settling in Courtney, B. C.

Richard loved cars.  He rebuilt his l935 Ford Sedan and painted it the new Ford color, Mercury Blue.  It was in this car in 1937 that he was on holiday and took cousin Clara and his mother to Victoria.  They had a good time.  After returning to Nanaimo, they went over to Vancouver to take in the Exhibition.  His Auntie Lil met them at the ferry terminal and took them out to Exhibition Park for another great day.

Another favorite car was his Lincoln Zepher.  In his own words, “she was a grand old car”.  He replaced the twelve cylinder engine with an industrial V8 engine.  He couldn’t get a twelve cylinder to fit but it was very powerful after.  He sold it in 1950 after driving it for fourteen years.

Richard worked for Bloedel, Stewart and Welch, running the speeder taking crews in and out of Camp 5.  With his love of the automobile, he ended his working career repairing upholstery, etc. in old cars for Corfield Motors.

He never married but enjoyed the company of his mother until she died in 1977 at 91 years of age.  Alex lived until 1981.

Cousin Dick still lives in Courtney, now in his nineties, and is watched over by his very good friends Alma and Gordon Williams.
