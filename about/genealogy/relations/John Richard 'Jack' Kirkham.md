#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

John Richard (Jack) Kirkham was born to [[(48ii) John Kirkham]] and [[Mary Ann Caswell]].  We have no record of when he was born and only know his wife as M. Allbut.

At one time in his life, he had experienced financial difficulty. His business was then in the manufacture of fancy glass gas lampshades. Electricity was coming into use, the business failed and money had to be found. His brother Francis Albert and Jack’s father-in-law Mr. Allbut, stood security for him. Billy remembered his Dad having Uncle Jack’s Jacobean dining room suite and a very lush armchair - “to sit in it was like resting on a cloud”. It lasted for years.

Jack won 37000 pounds. He was then Director Secretary at Eadies of Wolverhampton. It was about 1957. Billy mentioned this in reference to George (last child of Richard Kirkham and Elizabeth Rogers) and football betting.

Jack and his wife had two children.  One a son, Dr. John Hiram Kirkham, Orthopedic surgeon, who lived (in 1970) in Wolverhampton at Mallyan House, 32 Compton Hill Drive, Compton.

There was not a lot of closeness amongst the families in later years, however, Jack did visit his brother Francis Albert before he died, staying with him until Albert’s daughter Edith came home from work. Uncle Jack, whenever he spoke to [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]], always called him Francis.
