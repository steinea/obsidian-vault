#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

“Billy” was the first child born to Francis Albert Kirkham and Margaret (Madge) Fallon on September 7, 1910.

In 1969, it was Billy who tracked down the extended family in Canada, when by chance he wrote to [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]], Sr. in Vancouver, B. C.  Some of his information needed clarification and there was no one better to consult than Alfred.  He could set the record straight with his vivid memory.  From their correspondence, much was learned of the family in England.  I will try to reconstruct Billy’s life as he wrote of it.

His family was living on Bell Street, Tipton, England, when [[(24) Richard Kirkham]] visited. Richard’s son [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] had already returned to England, in 1915, from Nanaimo, B. C. Canada, and Richard took up residence with Alfred’s family. Billy’s grandfather, [[(48ii) John Kirkham]], died January 28, 1919.  John was Richard’s brother and his death apparently precipitated the visit. Gramp told ten year old Billy how he had tried as a boy to untie a knot in his shoelace with a fork.  The fork slipped, poking his eye, and Richard lost sight in the eye. Billy remembered Gramp reciting Shakespeare and thought he was a student of the work.  

For many weeks following the departure of Uncle Richard, Billy visited the tobaconists and with money given to him by his father, purchased some snuff.  This was placed in an envelope which in turn was wrapped into the “Tipton Herald” and sent off to Uncle Richard.  

A friend of Billy’s father, Alfred Allen, was prominent in Billy’s life through the family association.  Billy was a child, of course, but often Alfred Allen would sit like a statue while Billy drew a picture of him.  These sittings would take place at “The Bell Inn”, Bill and Alice Aston’s place.  Every time, Alfred Allen gave Billy a golden sovereign, which his mother always took from him.  

This Alfred Allen must have been quite the character driven by his chauffeur Joe Lewis, in his ‘red’ bean car.  You can read all about him in Billy’s letter dated September 23, 1970, pages three and four.  

Billy and his brother Bernard attended Dudley Grammar School until, as he said, “we became poor.” He left just before reaching the age of fourteen (1924). In his short lifetime, Billy’s father won and lost fortunes. One can gather from what Billy has written that the relatives didn’t want to have much to do with them. Fortunately for Billy, he had a close friend and associate in his mother’s brother Billy Fallon. Alfred Kirkham’s comment to Billy relative to Billy’s lamenting the family not being close was, “they’re a funny lot, falling out and falling in.”  

From Bell Street, the family moved to Castle Road.  When they left Tipton, it was to Great Bridge they went, to operate a pub.  

Francis Albert “Billy” Kirkham married Vera Kathleen Keeling on December 24, 1935, at St. Michaels Church, Tividale, Tipton, Staffordshire, England.  They had been courting nearly four years - engaged - but not any money to start married life, and then Vera’s father died. Billy could share Vera’s home.  

Billy’s mother died just after midnight on December 28, 1935.  Billy’s father took ill.  What a hectic time it was for him living at Burnt Tree with Vera, working for an engineering firm in Great Bridge and staying with his father in Five Way’s late evenings - checking on his father early mornings, too. This went on for several months until his death June 6, 1936.  

Just before the war, Billy was a ‘Special Constable’ at the police station and ‘goal’ on Stone Street, Dudley.   

Billy rose to Captain in the British Army (October 1944) during the Second World War.  He was invalided out of the army.  The family left Tipton in 1946. They lived in Wombourne near Wolverhampton; then to Merionethshire, North Wales and finally, Suffolk.  

“In 1947, the then socialist government decided to help the war disabled and provided initially 150 cars for the handicapped - either Ford or Morris. I being one of the singularly lucky nominee’s, was awarded such a vehicle. This did not however come to hand until 1949. I was in hospital at the time of notification so the handing-over had to be postponed until my release in 1950. Such, ultimately being handed over by “Rab”, now Lord Butler and Brigadier De Vaisey …” .  The car was a Ford Anglica.  

Billy and Vera raised one daughter Maureen, and two sons, Robin and Patrick. Robin’s career in the R.A.F. meant living at times far away from England. It was in 1970, Billy and Vera had a most enjoyable holiday visiting Robin and his wife Jenny in Germany.

[[(12iii) Jack Kirkham]], June and their daughter Leslie were the first members of the Canadian Kirkham’s to visit “The Corner Cottage in Bulmer, Sudbury, Suffolk, in 1971.  Lil’s son Doug stayed a few days with Billy and Vera in 1972 when Doug was on a trek around the world. Billy wrote of Doug’s visit, “I must state that I admire him for the spirit of adventure. I enquired how far he had travelled. He did not know off-hand, but we got down to the task of working out the distance, 13,000 miles - another 12,000 to and from Canada equals 25,000 miles.  Not a bad effort”. [[(6) Albert Kirkham]], [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] and their children Robert and Lynette visited Billy and Vera in 1973, when Patrick and wife Hazel’s daughter Sarah was just a little one. [[(12ii) Alfred Kirkham]]’s daughters Margaret and Patricia also visited England during those years.

Billy suffered great pain from the rheumatism that ravaged his joints. Operations in later years did not improve his mobility. His interest in researching the generations of Kirkham, gave him great pleasure, to the end.

Francis Albert (Billy) Kirkham died on April 5, 1974, in York, England. He was cremated and his ashes scattered at Kirkham Priory. His wife Vera died on July 28, 2002 in Colchester, Essex, England.  She is buried in the Parish Church Cemetery in Halstead, Essex, where her son Patrick and his wife Hazel attend services.
