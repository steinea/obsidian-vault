#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

Albert was born November 5th, 1877, to John Kirkham and Mary Ann Caswell.  At the time of his birth, the family was living at No. 2 High Street, Princes End, Tipton, Staffordshire, England.

According to [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]], “My father enjoyed himself in the company of Alfred Allen - who, to this day, I believe, was the ruin of my father’s life - horse racing, gambling and drinking, intermingled with local politics - Albert Kirkham could have been a brilliant man!  When there were family get-togethers, Albert with his scotch “always the gay one - always merry and bright.  He would sing ‘look around and you will find every cloud is silver-lined - a short life and a gay one - ‘ the Acadian’s, Gilbert & Sullivan.”  

He was married April 16th, 1906, to Margaret (Madge) Fallon/Floone/Falloona (spelling variations) born Nov. 12th, 1885.  Their wedding took place at St. Thomas Roman Catholic Church in Dudley, Worcestershire.  They had eight children starting with [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]] (nicknamed Billy), Bernard, Kathleen, Edith, Wilfred, Hilda Muriel, Francis Laurence and Joseph.

Margaret had to put up with a lot - fortunes won and lost due to her husband’s lifestyle. At one time they had a pub at Great Bridge “The Old Bush”.  Though his home was now in Great Bridge, Albert could not stay away from Tipton.  He kept going back to his old haunts and leaving his wife alone behind the bar.  On one of his visits, he was coming from Tipton, walking along Alexander Road and got as far as the cemetery gates when he fell down (tipsey!).  He remembered Alice Aston had recently died and was buried there.  He got up, said “goodnight Alice” and started walking again, but alas, in the wrong direction.  He was almost back in Tipton before realizing what he had done.  He turned, rounded off by falling again, and decided to stay put until it was light.  He got back to the “Old Bush Inn” a tired, dirty and bedraggled man.  His wife sat up nearly all night waiting for him.  

At one time, Albert was working in Birmingham.  Typical of the Kirkham’s we know and there sayings and expressions, a memorable ditty of Albert’s survived for his son Billy to share with us.   “Oh Mr. Porter.  What shall I do?  Was what he used to sing during his Sunday morning vocal endeavour.  I recall him telling the story of getting on the train at Birmingham, well comforted with beverage.  He dropped off to sleep, passed through Dudley Port, and Wolverhampton and was awakened by a porter at Crews”.  

Margaret died while living on Dudley Road in Tipton, just after midnight on December 28, 1935, three days after her son Francis Albert (Billy) and Vera Kathleen Keeling were married.  Her burial was New Years Day 1936.  

Albert was broken up after the burial.  He could have caught a cold at the cemetery.  He went to bed and didn’t seem to get any better.  He was taken into hospital and stayed for some time.  It was determined he wasn’t going to get any better and was taken to his home on Dudley Road in Tipton, where he died June 6, 1936 at 58 years old.  

Billy stated he could go on for hours on his Dad’s ‘rise and fall’ but chose to best remember him with, “jacket off at the end of a billiard table; gold armlets and cufflinks; ruby-gold tie pin; gold hunter and Albert; and a flashing diamond ring.  He’s frighten any snooker player”.  

Billy received some pictures of Kirkham family members from Aunt May, wife of Wilfred Kirkham (pictured in Alfred and Elsie’s wedding picture in 1916).  Amongst them was a picture taken late 1918 of Alfred’s Uncle Jack (Billy’s grandfather).  In it Jack is wearing the gold tie pin Billy described his father wearing.

Francis Albert was quite a snooker player.  He won the Conservative Snooker Championship and was presented with a solid silver case inscribed and presented by Lord Ednam, Earl of Dudley.
