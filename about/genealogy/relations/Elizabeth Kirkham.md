#### Biography

*Written by [[(7) Lorraine Fitzpatrick]] after reading letters [[(12) Alfred Kirkham]] received from his second cousin [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]].*

Elizabeth (Lizzie) was born to [[(48ii) John Kirkham]]  and [[Mary Ann Caswell]].  She married Harry Myatt. They had two daughters named Gertie and Lilly.

When [[Francis Albert 'Billy' Kirkham]]’s father took ill after Billy’s mother died, Billy chose to change doctors to get a second opinion.

He chose a doctor that had lived with his Aunt Lizzie Myatt on first coming to the Tipton District. Her brother Francis Albert had no means to pay for a specialist but when Billy confronted him with his concern, Francis Albert replied, “Don’t worry Billy.  I have a pound or two.” Billy suspected Aunt Lizzie, when she came to visit, had given him some money.  She called in on Saturdays. At that time she was living at Hagley.
