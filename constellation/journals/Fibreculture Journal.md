"The Fibreculture Journal is a peer reviewed international journal, first published in 2003 to explore issues and ideas within the Fibreculture network. The Journal now serves wider social formations across the international community. We work with those thinking critically about, and working with, contemporary digital and networked media, and related transversal thought."
