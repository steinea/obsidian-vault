"Influential Video Game Designers is the first series to take seriously the role of game designer. By profiling game designers who have shaped contemporary video gaming, this series provides insights into the practice, history, and artistry of game design; and responds to a growing interest in the artistic and cultural value of games and an increased focus on the practice of game design."
