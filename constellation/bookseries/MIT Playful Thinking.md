"Playful Thinking is a series of short, readable and argumentative books that share some playfulness and excitement with the games that they are about. The basic assumption is simple: video games are such a flourishing medium that any new perspective on them is likely to show us something unseen or forgotten, including those from such “unconventional” voices as artists, philosophers, or specialists in other industries or fields of study."
