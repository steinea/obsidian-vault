"The Landmark Video Games series is the first English-language series in which each book addresses a specific game or game series (some of which will include sequels, series, and spin-offs), examining it in the light of a variety of approaches, including game design, genre, form, content, and its context within video game history. The books in the series collectively produce an intimate examination of the video game medium through the close examination of the landmark games that make it up."
