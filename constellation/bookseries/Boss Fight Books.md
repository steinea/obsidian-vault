"Boss Fight Books, founded in Los Angeles in June 2013, publishes nonfiction documentary-style books about classic video games. Each of our books takes a critical, historical, and personal look at a single game. Some books focus on the history of the gameâ€™s creation, some focus on particular elements like level design, story, and music, some investigate the subculture that has formed around a game, and some reflect on the game's role in the author's own life."
