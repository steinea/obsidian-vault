"Digital Game Studies is a series dedicated to the investigation of the largest, fastest growing, and most popular form of mediated entertainmentâ€”the video/computer game. In responses to the growth in gaming over the last two decades, games, gamer culture, and gaming practices have increasingly become the focus of academic publications, conference panels, and university courses. Digital Game Studies provides an academic publishing outlet for this new research on games, gamers, and gaming."
