Sachs, Carl B. *Intentionality and the Myths of the Given: Between Pragmatism and Phenomenology*. Routledge, 2014. [9781138731554](https://www.routledge.com/Intentionality-and-the-Myths-of-the-Given-Between-Pragmatism-and-Phenomenology/Sachs/p/book/9781138731554). 

> Intentionality is one of the central problems of modern philosophy. How can a thought, action or belief be about something? Sachs draws on the work of [[Wilfrid Sellars]], [[C. I. Lewis]] and [[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]] to build a new theory of intentionality that solves many of the problems faced by traditional conceptions.
