### Abstract

> One of Gilles Deleuze’s earliest works, published in 1953 before the heyday of structuralism, Empiricism and Subjectivity anticipates and explains the post-structuralist turn to empiricism. At last available in paperback, the book presents a challenging and controversial reading of David Hume's philosophy, with comprehensive coverage of Hume's main texts and ideas. It lays the foundation for Deleuze's later work and is invaluable for understanding the evolution of Deleuze's thought from Hume to Kant to Nietzsche. Constantin V. Boundas's translation profoundly influenced the discussion of Deleuze and his theory of difference. Empiricism and Subjectivity took a significant step toward the idea of ethics without morality and offered an important contribution to the debate about the vanishing subject. Deleuze himself provides a preface to this English-language edition.
