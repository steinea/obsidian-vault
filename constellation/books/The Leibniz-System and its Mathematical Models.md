Serres, Michel. *The Leibniz-System and its Mathematical Models: Stars, Diagrams, Points.* Translated by Bill Ross. Birkhäuser, 2024. [9783035623925](https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/the-leibniz-system-and-its-mathematical-models-michel-serres/1143419618).

<br>

There is a strange reference to a re-translation (re-publication?) of this translation of Serres’s doctoral thesis, translated by Bill Ross for Clinamen originally in 2003 (see [9781903083178](https://www.abebooks.com/9781903083178/System-Leibniz-Philosophy-Science-Michel-1903083176/plp) on AbeBooks).

It appears that Bill Ross was the founder of Clinamen, but his [author page](https://edinburghuniversitypress.com/bill-ross/) at Edinburgh University Press indicates that he passed in 2022.
