### Abstract

> The sixth book of Virgil’s Aeneid, in which Aeneas travels into the underworld to meet the spirit of his father, is a story that captivated Seamus Heaney from his schooldays. But the work took on a special significance for him after the death of his own father, becoming a touchstone to which he would return as an adult. His noble and moving translation of Book VI bears the fruit of a lifetime’s concentration upon it: he began translating passages in the 1980s, and was finalising the work right up to the summer of his death. It was, he said, 'a constant presence', infusing and inspiring his original verse, culminating in its impact with his final collection, Human Chain. It seems almnost miraculous to be able to publish a new work by Seamus Heaney after his passing, as if even now he were capable of offering his readers a gift. That the gift should be Book VI of the Aeneid only adds to the poignancy of a work that marks the end of Seamus Heaney’s poetic journey.
