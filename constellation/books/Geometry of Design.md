### Abstract

> The very first volume in our acclaimed Design Briefs series is now available in a revised and updated second edition. Geometry of Design is a comprehensive overview of the principles of proportion and composition. Using detailed diagrams and vellum overlays, author Kimberly Elam clearly illustrates how naturally occurring systems of measurement create symmetry, order, and visual balance in a broad spectrum of successful modern designs. From Bauhaus posters to Mies van der Rohe's Barcelona Chair and the Volkswagen Beetle, Geometry of Design illuminates fundamental design concepts while offering valuable insight into the methodology of history's great artists, designers, and architects.
