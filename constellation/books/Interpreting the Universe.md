> John Macmurray argued that philosophers should learn to think from the standpoint of action, which involves participation in real life, and not from the perspective of the pure thinking self for whom the world is an object. At the heart of all his work was his attempt to reverse modern philosophy's commitment to an 'egocentric' starting point, with the self understood primarily as thinker withdrawn from action and participation in the world. Macmurray did not reject the work of philosophy as reflective activity, but he tried to recast its role in the service of more fulfilling and more basic personal communion with other, with the world, and utimately with God. This concern for community, or persons in relation, has become one of the major preoccupations of many of the cutting-edge debates in contemporary philosophy and religion and is inspiring new directions in moral theory within those circles. Indeed, it can be said that Macmurray's work is really a 'philosophy of community.' In *Interpreting the Universe*, first published in 1933, John Macmurray laid down the foundations for his subsequent exploration of community. Much of the contemporary discussion surrounding the idea proceeds from his work.
