"*The Jakarta Method: Washington's Anticommunist Crusade and the Mass Murder Program that Shaped Our World* is a 2020 political history book by American journalist and author Vincent Bevins. It concerns U.S. government support for and complicity in anti-communist mass killings around the world and their aggregate consequences from the Cold War until the present era. The title is a reference to Indonesian mass killings of 1965â€“66, during which an estimated one million people were killed in an effort to destroy the political left and movements for government reform in the country."
