# Twice-told Tales

[[books]] / [[Literature]]

Hawthorne, Nathaniel. *Twice-told Tales*. [[Ohio State University Press]]. [9780814202029](https://ohiostatepress.org/books/BookPages/HawthorneCentenary.htm).

From [Wikipedia](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twice-Told_Tales):

> Hawthorne was encouraged by friend Horatio Bridge to collect these previously anonymous stories; Bridge offered $250 to cover the risk of the publication. Many had been published in _The Token_, edited by Samuel Griswold Goodrich. When the works became popular, Bridge revealed Hawthorne as the author in a review he published in the _Boston Post_.
>
> The title _Twice-Told Tales_ was based on a line from William Shakespeare's _King John_ (Act 3, scene 4): "Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale, / Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man." The quote referenced may also be Hawthorne's way of acknowledging a belief that many of his stories were ironic retellings of familiar tropes.
