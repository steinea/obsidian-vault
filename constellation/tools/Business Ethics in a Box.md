"Business Ethics in a Box is a free, comprehensive, open-access teaching and learning resource for faculty and students interested in business ethics. Our goal is to revolutionize business ethics teaching by creating content that better suits the needs of todayâ€™s business students.

Business Ethics in a Box includes free, open-access syllabi, annotated lecture slides on a wide range of topics, lecture notes, in-class activities, and descriptions of novel assessment activities and deliverables. These materials are suitable for classes for business ethics, social entrepreneurship, ethical leadership, PPE (politics, philosophy, and economics), effective altruism, moral psychology, and related classes. We will continuously update and expand these materials as we teach new courses and try new things."
