# Creeker Zine

<https://creekerzine.wordpress.com/>

"Creeker is a grassroots, anti-authoritarian zine series that aims to bring reflection, depth, variety, critique and continuity to the ongoing process of reflecting on the Ada’itsx/Fairy Creek blockade and related efforts. It’s intended for creekers themselves, land defenders elsewhere, and the land defenders yet to come."
