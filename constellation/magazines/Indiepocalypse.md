"It’s the question of everyone’s mind, what is Indiepocalypse? Indiepocalypse, as the term originates, is the idea that an increase in access to the ability to make and release games results in all “indie” games to be worse off. Now to unpack to this whole line of thinking is much more than I am interested in doing or is relevant really. I’ll just say I adopted the name Indiepocalypse for this zine (the thing you are about to learn about) but I find the whole notion to be absurd and/or the inevitable state for all art."
