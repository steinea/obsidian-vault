"[Changed from Wireframe to whynow since I originally saved this.] Launched in March 2023, whynow Gaming is dedicated to everything that is fascinating, creative, and downright strange about video games. Just as our main site, whynow, takes an informed, witty, lively approach to arts, entertainment and culture, whynow Gaming celebrates video games as a unique medium: a complex, discipline-spanning, bewitching, sometimes baffling artform."
