"In early 1987, sitting around a dining room table, two young fiction writers, Kristine Kathryn Rusch and Dean Wesley Smith came up with the idea for Pulphouse. And by the end of that year they had published two issues of the acclaimed Pulphouse: A Hardback Magazine and had bought the equally acclaimed Axolotl Press."
