# Los Angeles Review of Books

[[publications]] / <https://lareviewofbooks.org/>

> The _Los Angeles Review of Books_ is a nonprofit organization dedicated to promoting and disseminating rigorous, incisive, and engaging writing on every aspect of literature, culture, and the arts.
>
> The _Los Angeles Review of Books_ magazine was created in part as a response to the disappearance of the traditional newspaper book review supplement, and, with it, the art of lively, intelligent long-form writing on recent publications in every genre, ranging from fiction to politics. The _Los Angeles Review of Books_ seeks to revive and reinvent the book review for the internet age, and remains committed to covering and representing today’s diverse literary and cultural landscape.
>
> _LARB_ publishes new reviews, essays, and interviews online every day, as well as a print journal, [_The_ LARB _Quarterly_](https://lareviewofbooks.org/editions/). We also publish a collection of independent sister magazines, [the LARB Channels and Affiliates](https://lareviewofbooks.org/channels).
>
> Our civic arts programs are designed to advance the next generation of editors and publishers. These include [the LARB Publishing Workshop](http://www.thepublishingworkshop.com/), an immersive, collaborative program designed for students and innovators interested in publishing. Internships at LARB are available for college credit year-round.
>
> LARB offers events and public arts programs that connect writers and artists to readers both in Los Angeles and across the globe. [The LARB Book Club](https://dev.lareviewofbooks.org/book-club), a part of our [membership program](https://lareviewofbooks.org/join/), meets on a quarterly basis and includes live readings with selected authors; the LARB Luminary Evening series features writers in conversation with readers in homes around Los Angeles.
