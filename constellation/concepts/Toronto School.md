> The Toronto School is a school of thought in communication theory and literary criticism, the principles of which were developed chiefly by scholars at the University of Toronto. It is characterized by exploration of Ancient Greek literature and the theoretical view that communication systems create psychological and social states. The school originated from the works of [[Eric A. Havelock]] and [[Harold Innis]] in the 1930s, and grew to prominence with the contributions of [[Edmund Snow Carpenter]], [[Northrop Frye]] and [[Marshall McLuhan]].

> Since 1963, the McLuhan Program in Culture and Technology at the University of Toronto Faculty of Information has carried the mandate for teaching and advancing the school. Notable contemporary scholars associated with the Toronto School include Derrick de Kerckhove, Robert K. Logan and Barry Wellman
