"GIFCon owes both its existence and its philosophy to the project that led to its foundation: the Fantasy Masters programme at the University of Glasgow, and the Centre for Fantasy and the Fantastic which that programme spawned. Like the MLitt and the Centre, Glasgow International Fantasy Conversations is a meeting-place for academics, creative writers, and other fantasy-minded folks (we call them fantasts) to come together and discuss fantastical works in a supportive setting."
