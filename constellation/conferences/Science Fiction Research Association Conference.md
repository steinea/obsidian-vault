"Science fiction and the fantastic (SFF) have the power to disrupt entrenched narratives and worldmaking practices. Whether in the form of hard science fiction, utopian speculation, high fantasy or supernatural horror, SFF is fundamentally anchored in imaginations of disruptionâ€”a tear in the fabric of reality, an estrangement of the senses, a break with the known world, or a transgression of boundaries."
