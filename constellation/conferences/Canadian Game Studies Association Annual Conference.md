"The [[Canadian Game Studies Association]] (CGSA/ACÉJ) is an organization dedicated to the interdisciplinary study of digital games. Its primary goal is to support the work of Canadian researchers, graduate students, artists, game designers, programmers, theorists, and others working in this field … We invite submissions from all disciplines and researchers working on or around games including digital and non-digital games. Graduate student submissions and submissions from scholars outside of Canada are welcome and encouraged! … CGSA/ACÉJ enthusiastically welcomes other and experimental types of in-person, virtual, and hybrid contributions including workshops, game demonstrations/prototypes, etc. Please contact the CGSA/ACÉJ 2024 organizers in advance of the deadline with a brief summary of your proposed format, anticipated equipment needs, and an estimated length of time requested. Be sure to indicate if remote virtual participation will be possible."
