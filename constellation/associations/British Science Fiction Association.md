"If you are interested in Science Fiction, then you've come to the right place. The British Science Fiction Association's mission is to support and promote SF in all its forms. We're glad you've found us. The BSFA was created by a group of fans in 1958, and was soon established and run as an official national body by readers, authors, critics, editors, booksellers and publishers with the aim of appreciating and encouraging science fiction in every form."
