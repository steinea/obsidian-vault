“The Royal Society of Literature (RSL) celebrates and supports writing of all kinds. We are a charity for writers and readers throughout their literary lives.

We’re led by writers and we believe that all literature matters. We work with schools and prisons because everyone should have access to books. We celebrate the achievements of authors. We provide writers at all stages of their careers with the tools and resources they need to write. And we give readers access to the best writers from around the world.”
