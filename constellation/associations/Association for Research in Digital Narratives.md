"We believe in the power of the Interactive Digital Narratives (IDNs) to explain our complex world, to entertain and educate. We understand IDN as an umbrella term encompassing such forms as narrative-focused video games, AR/VR experiences, interactive documentaries, journalistic interactive and installation pieces, as well as emerging forms."
