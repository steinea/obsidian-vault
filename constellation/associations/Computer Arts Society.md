"The Computer Arts Society (CAS) was founded in 1968 to promote the understanding of the role of digital and electronic media in the arts. As it has developed over time, a key aim has become to ensure that the long history of the computer arts is recognised by contemporary artists, technologists, audiences and collectors."
