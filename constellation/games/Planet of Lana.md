# Planet of Lana

[[games]]

<https://planetoflana.com/>

> A planet that used to be a place of undisturbed balance between human, nature and animal has now become something else entirely. The disharmony that had been in the making for hundreds of years has finally arrived in the form of a faceless army. But this is not a story about war. This is a story about a vibrant, beautiful planet â€“and the journey to keep it that way.
