# King of Dragon Pass

[[games]]

<https://a-sharp.com/kodp/>

> King of Dragon Pass is a unique game for iPad, iPhone, Android, Windows, macOS, and Windows Phone, set in Glorantha (world of the games RuneQuest and HeroQuest). It blends interactive stories and resource management into an epic saga of conflict, magic, and community.
>
> The original version ran on Windows and Macintosh. We streamlined game play, added dozens of new stories and more art, and reworked the interface for touch.
>
> King of Dragon Pass won the Best Visual Arts award at the second annual Independent Games Festival. You can buy original artwork used to make the game. T-shirts, sweatshirts, mugs, and mouse pads are also available. And you can listen to the music!
>
> It’s an indie game that’s stood the test of time. Start your own magical story now!
