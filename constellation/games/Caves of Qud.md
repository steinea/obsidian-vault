# Caves of Qud

[[games]]

<https://www.cavesofqud.com/>

> Caves of Qud is a science fantasy RPG & roguelike epic. It’s set in a far future that’s deeply simulated, richly cultured, and rife with sentient plants.
> 
> Come inhabit an exotic world and chisel through a layer cake of thousand-year-old civilizations.
> 
> Play the role of a mutant from the salt-spangled jungles of Qud, or play as a true-kin descendant from one of the few remaining eco-domes: the toxic arboreta of Ekuemekiyye, the ice-sheathed arcology of Ibul, or the crustal mortars of Yawningmoon.
