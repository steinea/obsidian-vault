# Alba: A Wildlife Adventure

[[Games]]

<https://www.albawildlife.com/>

> Join Alba as she visits her grandparents on a Mediterranean island. She is ready for a peaceful summer of wildlife exploration with her friend Ines, but when she sees an animal in danger, she realises she needs to do something about it!
> 
> We based this on our childhood summers and, well, we wish we could go back. This island is the next best thing.
> 
> Make your time on the island your own and experience the adventure at your own pace. No rush.
> 
> We worked with Lorena Alvarez, to make a soundtrack that is equal parts Spain and Amazing.
> 
> Honestly, a feel-good game about running around and doing good deeds.
