# Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out

[[games]]

<https://sixages.com/>

> Your ancestors united two rival clans and formed a powerful tribe. Then Chaos broke the world and killed most of your gods. Can you protect your people and cling to survival as the world ends?
> 
> Six Ages 2: Lights Going Out is the sequel to Six Ages: Ride Like the Wind, and the spiritual successor to cult hit King of Dragon Pass. It combines interactive fiction and turn-based strategy to immerse you in a hostile, blood-soaked land governed by myth and cursed with wonders. Uncover the secrets of the valley, battle fearsome monsters, and meet the gods, all while protecting your people and raiding your neighbors’ cows. Hundreds of scenes unfurl, accompanied by gorgeous artwork and backed by a clan simulation that makes every game unique. You’ll be faced with hard choices, but you’ll get advice to follow or ignore — although your advisors have their own agendas.
