# FTL: Faster Than Light

[[Games]]

<https://subsetgames.com/ftl.html>

>In FTL you experience the atmosphere of running a spaceship trying to save the galaxy. It's a dangerous mission, with every encounter presenting a unique challenge with multiple solutions.
>
> What will you do if a heavy missile barrage shuts down your shields?  
>
> * Reroute all power to the engines in an attempt to escape?
> * Power up additional weapons to blow your enemy out of the sky?
> * Or take the fight to them with a boarding party?
>
> This "spaceship simulation roguelike-like" allows you to take your ship and crew on an adventure through a randomly generated galaxy filled with glory and bitter defeat.
