# Momodora Reverie Under the Moonlight

[[games]]

<https://momodorarutm.dangenentertainment.com/>

> Kaho, a priestess from the village of Lun, seeks an audience with the Queen of Karst who can surely lift the curse from the land. However, all is not as it seems in Karst. Each encounter raises more questions than it answers and each step takes Kaho deeper into the shadows cast by the curse.
>
> Combo and dodge through a lovingly crafted pixel art world full of monsters and bosses. Carve out your path to Castle Karst as you see fit and lift the curse that threatens all life in the kingdom.
