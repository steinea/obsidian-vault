> Stray Gods is an epic tale of gods, magic, and a millennium-long journey to rediscover oneâ€™s purpose. 
>
> Dive into an urban fantasy world of music and adventure, where reality and the supernatural collide in strange and nefarious ways. You play as Grace, recently bequeathed with the power of song by the Last Muse who chose to pass you her gift before dying in your arms. Armed with the power of spectacular musical numbers, you have one week to prove your innocence in the Muse's death before a group of mythological beings known as the Chorus - take your life as punishment.
>
> Make friends, foes, or lovers as Grace navigates through this treacherous journey and engage in a celestial battle of wit and musical might.
