> Destroy... Absorb... Grow... GRIME is a fast and unforgiving Action-Adventure RPG in which you crush your foes with living weapons that mutate form and function, and then consume their remains with a black hole to strengthen your vessel as you break apart a world of anatomical horror and intrigue.
>
> Explore weeping caves, face-covered deserts, and distinct civilizations all rendered in  unearthly 3D. Face foes born from the world itself, and swallow them whole.
> 
> Punish enemies by parrying their attacks, smash them from the ground or even airborne, and absorb them to grow your strength as you wage war on a living world.
> 
> Seamlessly swap weapons made of living creatures that mutate form during combat, from clawing swords to centipede whips.
> 
> Consume bosses to gain game-changing abilities. Hunt down and absorb challenging monsters to progress through your skill tree and bring true customization to your play style.
> 
> Find and kill bosses dozens of times your size and gain new abilities that will let you explore further into the world of GRIME.
