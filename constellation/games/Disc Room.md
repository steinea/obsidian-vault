# Disc Room

[[games]]

<https://discroom.com/>

“Are you ready to get sliced in half? The year is 2089 and a giant disc has appeared in orbit of Jupiter. Step into the oversized space suit of a brave scientist and explore this sprawling intergalactic slaughterhouse. And remember: what kills you only makes you stronger. Disc Room is a collaboration between Kitty Calis, Jan Willem Nijman, Terri Vellmann and Doseone.”
