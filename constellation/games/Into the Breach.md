>
> Perfect Your Strategy: All enemy attacks are telegraphed in minimalistic, turn-based combat. Analyze your opponentâ€™s attack and come up with the perfect counter every turn.

> Build the Ultimate Mech: Find powerful new weapons and unique pilots as you battle the Vek infestation across Corporate-Nation islands.
>
> Another Chance: Failure is not an option. When you are defeated, send help back through time to save another timeline!
