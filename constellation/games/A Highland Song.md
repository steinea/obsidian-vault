# A Highland Song

[[games]]

<https://www.inklestudios.com/a-highland-song/>

> A wild adventure through the Scottish Highlands, with open platforming and dynamic storytelling, maps and music. From the creators of [Heaven's Vault](https://www.inklestudios.com/heavensvault), [Overboard!](https://www.inklestudios.com/overboard) and [80 Days](https://www.inklestudios.com/80days).
> 
> Climb peaks to orient yourself and plan your next steps. Spelunk caves, scale cliffs, jump from rock to rock and slide down scree slopes as you make your way forward.
> 
> Wind, rain, and cold are your enemies. Moira is no superhero, and the Highlands are not to be underestimated. Shelter to survive.
> 
> Collect and position 100 map fragments to discover faster routes. The hills crisscrossed with paths: well-trodden, others hidden away.
> 
> Learn the stories and the secrets of the hills, which are filled with lost things, echoes, and memories.
> 
> Skip and jump through the valleys to the incredible music of TALISK and Fourth Moon. The landscape itself forms itself around the shape of the music.
> 
> Get ready to make the journey more than once, because a single trip isn't nearly enough to discover the Highlands' deepest secrets.
