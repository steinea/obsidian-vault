# Hello, world ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Eric, and this is the readme for my personal site. I am a Gameplay Development Director at Electronic Arts, a Certified Associate in Project Management (Project Management Institute, 2021), a Game Development Instructor at Trinity Western University, and a game studies scholar with an M.A. in Interdisciplinary Humanities (Trinity Western University, 2018) and a B.A. Hons. in English Literature and Creative Writing (Simon Fraser University, 2016).

This repository is the source for my Obsidian vault and published site. You can explore the markdown files directly here. This vault will eventually replace the current Jekyll deployment of my site at <www.steinea.ca>.
