### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Eric, and this is my personal site. I am a Gameplay Development Director at [[Electronic Arts]], a Certified Associate in Project Management ([PMI-CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm)), a Game Development Instructor at [[Trinity Western University]], and a game studies scholar with an M.A. in Interdisciplinary Humanities ([[Trinity Western University]], 2018) and a B.A. Hons. in English Literature and Creative Writing ([[Simon Fraser University]], 2016).

This readme is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ markdown file that serves as both the root of my [[Obsidian]] vault, and the repository for my [[GitHub]] profile, where this vault is also backed up and versioned. I use Obsidian [[Publish]] to make my vault visible to you, the reader, along with [[Netlify]] for my domain proxy and [[Hover]] for the DNS itself. My site logo and favicon were made on [[Picrew]], using â˜†[friend maker](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/1322863)â˜… by [Rowyn](https://pepperjackets.carrd.co/).

To start exploring this site, check out the [[sitemap]] and click through to what interests you. My [[blog]] includes all of my writing: occasional, formal, and otherwise. My [[collections]] include date-stamped notes and other errata that donâ€™t fall under my blog but are still most usefully understood in relation to my [[timeline]]. My [[constellation]] is my personal wiki or digital garden (though I prefer the celestial or cosmic metaphor), and consists of a loose list of categories, grouping non-date-stamped pages that are referenced elsewhere on the site with Obsidian [wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links).
