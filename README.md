### Hello, world ðŸ‘‹ 

Iâ€™m Eric, and this is my personal site. This readme is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ file that serves as both the root of my [[Obsidian]] vault, and the repository for my [[GitHub]] [profile](https://github.com/steinea), where this vault is also backed up and versioned. I use Obsidian [[Publish]] to make my vault visible to you, the reader, along with [[Netlify]] for my domain proxy and [[Hover]] for the DNS itself. My site logo and favicon were made on [[Picrew]], using â˜†[friend maker](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/1322863)â˜… by [Rowyn](https://pepperjackets.carrd.co/).

I am a Gameplay Development Director on [EA SPORTS FC](https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc), a Certified Associate in Project Management ([PMI-CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm)), a Game Development Instructor at TWU, and a game studies scholar with an M.A. in Interdisciplinary Humanities (2018) and a B.A. Hons. in English Literature and Creative Writing (2016).
