I’m Eric, and this is my personal site. I am a Gameplay Development Director at [[Electronic Arts]], a Certified Associate in Project Management ([PMI-CAPM](https://www.pmi.org/certifications/certified-associate-capm)), a Game Development Instructor at [[Trinity Western University]], and a game studies scholar with an M.A. in Interdisciplinary Humanities ([[Trinity Western University]], 2018) and a B.A. Hons. in English Literature and Creative Writing ([[Simon Fraser University]], 2016).

This readme is a special markdown file that serves as both the root of my [[Obsidian]] vault, and the repository for my [[GitHub]] profile, where this vault is also backed up and versioned. I use Obsidian [[Publish]] to make my vault visible to you, the reader, along with [[Netlify]] for my domain proxy and [[Hover]] for the DNS itself. My site logo and favicon were made on [[Picrew]], using ☆[friend maker](https://picrew.me/en/image_maker/1322863)★ by [Rowyn](https://pepperjackets.carrd.co/).

To start exploring this site, check out the sitemap below and click through to what interests you. My [[Activity]] feed includes all the different things I’m recording on a day to day basis. My [[Blog]] includes all of my writing: occasional, formal, and otherwise. My [[Collections]] include date-stamped notes and other errata that don’t fall under my blog but are still most usefully understood in relation to my [[Timeline]]. My [[Constellation]] is my personal wiki or digital garden (though I prefer the celestial or cosmic metaphor), and consists of a loose list of categories, grouping non-date-stamped pages that are referenced elsewhere on the site with Obsidian [wikilinks](https://help.obsidian.md/Linking+notes+and+files/Internal+links).
