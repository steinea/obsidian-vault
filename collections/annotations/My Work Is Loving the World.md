#### Messenger

"My work is loving the world" (1)

"my work, / which is mostly standing still and learning to be astonished" (1)

<br>


#### Walking Home from Oak-Head

"I'll stand in the doorway / stamping my boots and slapping my hands, / my shoulders / covered with stars" (3)

<br>


#### When I Am Among the Trees

"I am so distant from the hope of myself, / in which I have goodness, and discernment, / and never hurry through the world / but walk slowly, and bow often" (4)

"'It's simple,' they say, / 'and you too have come / into the world to do this, to go easy, to be filled / with light, and to shine'" (4)

<br>


#### Musical Notation: 1

"Clouds are not only vapor, but shape, mobility, silky sacks of nourishing rain" (7)

<br>


#### When the Roses Speak, I Pay Attention

"'As long as we are able to / be extravagant we will be / hugely and damply / extravagant. Then we will drop / foil by foil to the ground. This / is our unalterable task, and we do it / joyfully'" (9)

<br>


#### Cormorants

"God, how did it ever come to you to / invent Time?" (18)

<br>


#### The Place I Want to Get Back To

"Such gifts, bestowed / can't be repeated" (36)

<br>


#### Praying

"this isn't / a contest but the doorway / into thanks, and a silence in which / another voice may speak" (37)

<br>


#### Gethsemane

"Jesus said, wait with me. And maybe the stars did, maybe / the wind wound itself into a silver tree, and didn't move, maybe / the lake far away, where once he walked as on a blue pavement, / lay still and waited, wild awake" (45)

"Oh the dear bodies, slumped and eye-shut, that could not / keep the vigil, how they must have wept, / so utterly human, knowing this too / must be a part of the story" (45)
