# Her Again

### Anthony Lane

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[The New Yorker]]

“After all, film stars are those unlikely beings who seem more alive, not less, when images are made of them; who unfurl and reach toward the light, instead of seizing up, when confronted by a camera; and who, by some miracle or trick, become enriched versions of themselves, even as they ramify into other selves on cue.”
