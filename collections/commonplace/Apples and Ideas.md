# Apples and Ideas

### George Bernard Shaw

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Asymptote Journal]]

“If you have an apple and I have an apple and we exchange apples then you and I will still each have one apple. But if you have an idea and I have an idea and we exchange those ideas, then each of us will have two ideas.”
