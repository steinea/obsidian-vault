> This summer I plan to finish the novel I planned to finish last summer, and last winter, and this spring. It’s supposed to be out this year, and if it isn’t, I can always go back to writing short stories.
> 
> Of course, anyone who only publishes short stories is thought to be a ‘slender talent’ (and not in a nice way). But you can’t convince people you’re fat by writing just one novel - you’ve got to write two before you can publish short stories again, or they’ll say you’re ‘burnt out.’
> 
> One day I plan to start my own publishing company called 'Burnt Out, Inc.' and publish only short stories and novels people couldn't finish. The logo will show a candle burning at both ends.
> 
> If, on the other hand, I do finish ‘L.A. Woman’ (the novel I should have finished last summer), then next summer I plan to read ‘War and Peace.’
