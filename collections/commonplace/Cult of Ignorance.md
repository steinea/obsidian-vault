# Cult of Ignorance

### Isaac Asimov

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Newsweek]]

“There is a cult of ignorance in the United States, and there has always been. The strain of anti-intellectualism has been a constant thread winding its way through our political and cultural life, nurtured by the false notion that democracy means that 'my ignorance is just as good as your knowledge.”
