"Constraint may make him worse by making him a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man" (674). 

"It is error alone which needs the support of government. Truth can stand by itself" (675).

"The several sects [ecclesiastical denominations] perform the office of a Censor morum [critic of morals or customs] over each other" (675).
