"There are eight columns which firmly support lawful kingship: truth, patience, liberality, good counsel (veritas, patientia, largitas, persuasibilitas): formidableness, helpfulness, moderation, righteousness (correctio malorum, exultatio bonorum, levitas tributi, equitas iudicii). And seven things befit a righteous king: . . . awe of God . . . cherish righteousness . . . humble before God . . . resolute against evil . . . comfort and feed God’s poor . . . advance and protect the Church of God . . . order correct judgment for friend and stranger alike" (189). 

"Every lawful throne which stands perfectly upright, stands on three pillars: one is oratores, and the second is laboratores and the third is bellatores. . . . prayer-men . . . workmen . . . soldiers" (189).
