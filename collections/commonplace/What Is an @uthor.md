# What Is an @uthor?

### Matthew Kirschenbaum

[[2015]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Los Angeles Review of Books]]

"Of course, no one accepts Faulkner’s utterances as the ultimate authority on his work. We’re too sophisticated for that, and Faulkner himself cautioned that his statements and self-representations were that of a “man in motion.” That is, Faulkner the person understood himself to be in dialogue with his own public image."
