The nature of the subject with respect to itself and the “objective world”

*2024 Note: This is how the chart shows up… It’s very busted… I’ll try to restructure below, but also, I cannot find the original source. This chart, which I suppose I named “the consciousness grid” is NOT, in fact, the grid discussed in the linked NYRB article, and I cannot find an original source.*
