“This is the first moment in the history of our planet when any species, by its own voluntary actions, has become a danger to itself—as well as to vast numbers of others. … Some planetary civilizations see their way through, place limits on what may and and what must not be done, and safely pass through the time of perils. Others, not so lucky or so prudent, perish.”
