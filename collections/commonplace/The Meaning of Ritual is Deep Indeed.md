# The Meaning of Ritual is Deep Indeed

### Xunzi

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Google Books]]

"The meaning of ritual is deep indeed.

He who tries to enter it with the kind of perception that distinguishes hard and white, same and different, will drown there.

The meaning of ritual is great indeed.

He who tries to enter it with the uncouth and inane theories of the system-makers will perish there.

The meaning of ritual is lofty indeed.

He who tries to enter with the violent and arrogant ways of those who despise common customs and consider themselves to be above other men will meet his downfall there."
