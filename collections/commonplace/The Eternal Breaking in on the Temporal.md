# The Eternal Breaking in on the Temporal

### Marilynne Robinson

[[2015]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Gilead]]

"There is no justice in love, no proportion in it, and there need not be, because in any specific instance it is only a glimpse of parable of an embracing, incomprehensible reality. It makes no sense at all because it is the eternal breaking in on the temporal. So how could it subordinate itself to cause or consequence?"

Gilead (238)
