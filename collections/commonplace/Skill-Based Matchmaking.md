> I see mention of the skill-based matchmaking component I designed for Halo 2 and 3 on this site every so often. It's usually mentioned reverently, but then an outlier jumps in to claim "it can't work today". I disagree.
> 
> What I implemented cleanly divided the space into Ranked and Unranked matchmaking playlists. Ranked filtered opponents based on level. This was for when you wanted a competitive match - but even then, I intentionally allowed variability in the range of levels we matched you with.
> 
> This variability was a topic of hot debate internally, during development, 20 years ago. Obviously no one wants to get stomped continuously. On the flip side, it gets dull (for most people) continuously stomping others. However, it IS fun having the upper hand some of the time.
> 
> By intentionally allowing a range of skills to match together, we provided 3 experiences in ranked matchmaking: an easier one where you can kick butt, a harder one where you're likely outmatched, and an evenly matched one. My theory was that a good mix of these three was ideal.
> 
> Why not always evenly match people though? My reasoning was that these are actually the most stressful matches of the set. Sure, they're the most fun to watch for spectators: games come down to the wire. That's because the team that wins is the team that outperforms expectations.
> 
> The failure of modern skill-based matchmaking, imho, is that it's designed to maximize these perfect match scenarios and minimize the others. When it's working, a majority of games become super tight, super stressful. That's not fun for most players. Where's the variability?
