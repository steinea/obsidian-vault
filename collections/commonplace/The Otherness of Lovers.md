Keep cats 
<br>if you want to learn to cope with
<br>the otherness of lovers.
<br>Otherness is not always neglect --
<br>Cats return to their litter trays
<br>when they need to.
<br>Don't cuss out of the window
<br>at their enemies.
<br>That stare of perpetual surprise
<br>in those great green eyes
<br>will teach you
<br>to die alone.
