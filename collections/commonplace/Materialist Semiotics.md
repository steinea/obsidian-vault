“As a strategy to position himself outside of academia while still being part of it, Lotringer founded a journal with a group of Columbia students entitled Semiotext(e) in 1974. The idea was to discuss the epistemology of semiotics through the practice of “materialist” semiotics. Feeling limited by its linguistic model, Lotringer then turned to visual arts and the examination of non-verbal signs.”
