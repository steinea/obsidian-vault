# The Naysayers

### Alex Ross

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[The New Yorker]]

From []()

"Technology conspires with populism to create an ideologically vacant dictatorship of likes. "

"I am haunted by a sentence from Virginia Woolfâ€™s 'The Waves': 'One cannot live outside the machine for more perhaps than half an hour.'"
