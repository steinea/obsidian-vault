# What Disagreement Is Not

### Jacques Rancière

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Disagreement]]

“Disagreement is not the conflict between one who says white and another who says black. It is the conflict between one who says white and another who also says white but does not understand the same thing by it.”
