"At a time when support for a basic income is garnering increasingly more mainstream consideration, it is essential for the Left to make explicit the anticapitalist rationale for a UBI. Below are five important considerations."
 
"1. The purpose of a UBI is to free people from the tyranny of the job market."

"2. A UBI should exist as part of a suite of benefit programs."

"3. A UBI should be coupled with guaranteed access to public-sector employment."

"4. It can’t be done by Bitcoin."

"5. UBI should not have taxes baked in."
