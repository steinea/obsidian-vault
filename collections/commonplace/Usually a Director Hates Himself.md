# Usually a Director Hates Himself

### Natalie Portman

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[The New Yorker]]

“Usually, a director hates himself and projects that onto the male actor and is fighting with him the whole time, and then treats female actors as an avatar. You’re either ‘The woman I wish women would be like’ or ‘The woman I hate women for being like.’”
