# Matters of Faith

### Timothy Beal

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[Los Angeles Review of Books]]

"What’s essential about religion, we think, is what we think — and perhaps feel, but only so long as those feelings don’t involve our bodies."

"Religion, then, is fundamentally technological, and the history of religion is inseparable from the history of technology."
