# Spirit of Reform

### David Berlin

[[2014]] / [[commonplace]] / [[The Walrus]]

“Calling it the spirit of reform helps us to resist the temptation confronting every generation that experiences it—namely, to imagine that it is all about us and our times; that we are exceptional; that nothing like this has happened before or will ever happen again.”
