# Useless Passions

[[2020]] / [[blog]]

*Useless Passions* is a philosophy game inspired by Jean-Paul Sartre's work in [*Being and Nothingness*](https://www.routledge.com/Being-and-Nothingness-An-Essay-on-Phenomenological-Ontology/Sartre/p/book/9780415278485). It employs minimalist, player-driven mechanics to mobilize Sartre's philosophical concerns, getting players to explore questions of freedom and personal responsibility through play.

*Useless Passions* owes everything to the games that preceded it. These include: Avery Alder and Benjamin Rosenbaum's [*Dream Askew / Dream Apart*](https://store.buriedwithoutceremony.com/collections/frontpage/products/dream-askew-dream-apart), Vincent and Meguey Baker's [*Apocalypse World*](http://apocalypse-world.com/), Emily Care Boss's [*Shooting the Moon*](https://www.blackgreengames.com/shop/romancetrilogypdf), Jason Morningstar's [*The Skeletons*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/177596/The-Skeletons), and Jesse Ross's [*Trophy Dark*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/268198/) and [*Trophy Gold*](https://www.drivethrurpg.com/product/293716/).

The text is in A5 zine format. Select *booklet, two-sided to print*.
