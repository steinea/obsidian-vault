# A Game, Perhaps

[[2021]] / [[Blog]]

A list is a textual algorithm, or what we might also call a *game*.

This is a list made for [List Jam](https://itch.io/jam/list-jam) put on by [Coleo_Kin](https://coleo_kin.itch.io/) and [Critical Distance](https://www.critical-distance.com/). It is entirely inspired by the thought of Jacques Derrida, and specifically the title of Peter Salmon's biography of Derrida, [*An Event, Perhaps*](https://www.versobooks.com/books/3678-an-event-perhaps).

This game-object can be printed on the front and back of a 3x5 index card.

The cover and background image is taken from the inside cover of the Wave Books edition of Mallarm√©'s [*A Roll of the Dice*](https://www.wavepoetry.com/products/a-roll-of-the-dice).
