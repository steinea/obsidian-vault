# Generation Analog

[[2022]] / [[blog]]

Itâ€™s been extremely busy, but I was really happy to have had the chance to present at [Generation Analog](https://analoggamestudies.org/generation-analog-2022/) again this year. I was on the Participation and Pedagogy panel, and the whole thing (as well as all of the other panels) are now available on the Analog Game Studies [YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/oU_8wr6FGkU). The paper, which I mentioned [[Play to Lose|below]], is also available to read at [Zenodo](https://zenodo.org/record/6932651), in full and for free.
