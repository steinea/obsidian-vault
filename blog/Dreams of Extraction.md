### The Techno-Ecological Imaginary of Bethesda's *Starfield*

[[2024]] • [[Blog]]

#### Abstract

Taking the subtitle of Emil L. Hammar, Carolyn Jong, and Joachim Despland-Lichtert's 2023 paper as a spur—'no game studies on a dead planet'—this essay embarks on a critical close reading of the mining and crafting systems of Bethesda's *Starfield* (2023), focusing on the complexities that these game systems present for the player's enjoyment, and those complexities that are obscured or entirely ignored. Read against the broader ecological themes critical to the world building and main story of the game, we encounter a curious disjunction between what *Starfield* says it cares about, and what the game actually does care about in its design. Using critical theories of aesthetics, media, and games—Jacques Rancière, *The Politics of Aesthetics* (2013); Nicolas Bourriaud, *The Exform* (2016); Jussi Parikka, *A Geology of Media* (2015); and Benjamin Abraham, *Digital Games After Climate Change* (2022)—this paper attends to the *matter* of play in *Starfield*, undertaking the necessary cultural critique to be coupled with the pragmatic approach to the 'morbid symptoms' of the failing 'social and economic structures' identified in Hammar, Jong, and Despland-Lichtert's paper. It is my contention that *Starfield*'s techno-ecological imaginary is predicated on a mechanical exclusion of *waste* (Bourriaud, Parikka), employing a particular *distribution of sensibility* (Rancière) that elides the costs of industrial capitalism, costs which themselves are used for a key dramatic revelation late in the game's main campaign. The matter of play—the mechanics, systems, and structures with which players interact in gameplay—says as much as do the dialogue, exposition, and text artefacts found throughout the game world, but the *meaning* of this matter, I will argue, contradicts the meaning that the campaign attempts to convey through its explicit text. Unpacking such contradictions is the vital work of game studies. Indeed, as Abraham writes: 'Bringing the climate crisis 'home' to all of our lives, all of our workplaces, all of our hobbies, is the necessary first step in acting to reverse climate action' (3). Given the widespread availability of *Starfield* across Microsoft's platforms, and consequently the thousands, and potentially millions, of players who will encounter the questions of climate collapse and ecological responsibility that the game poses—many, perhaps, for the first time—it is essential that we address the material solutions that *Starfield* presents to its motivating climactic crisis, and provide a critical corrective to the elisions of the 'megatechnological fix' upon which these solutions rely (Ihde, *Technology and the Lifeworld*, 1990, 7). The erasure of waste in *Starfield*'s mining and crafting systems is precisely the same erasure that prevents us from effecting real change in the global technological systems that have brought us to the brink of planetary collapse.
