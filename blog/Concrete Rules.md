“There are rules, rules of ‘plan(n)ing,’ of diagramming, as we will see later on, or elsewhere…”

—Deleuze and Guattari, *A Thousand Plateaus*, 1980

This was going to be an rpg, but the game never arrived, only this set of terms, this collection of rules. They are concrete rules because they are real, but their reality makes them no less abstract in their possibility. Deleuze and Guattari sought a metaphysics for the mechanosphere, the cosmicization of beings and concepts. These are the rules they provide.
