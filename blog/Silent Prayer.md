# Silent Prayer

[[2020]] / [[blog]]

This game does not attempt to reproduce John Cage’s *4’33”* in game space, but rather to *extend* it, to re-enter the scene with new instruments.

*Silent Prayer* is a gmless, solo ttrpg that can be printed as a half-letter zine on the front and back of a single letter-sized piece of paper.

The photo of Cage on the itch.io page was taken by Rob Bogaerts and sourced from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Opdracht_GPD_componist_John_Cage_,_kop,_Bestanddeelnr_934-2728.jpg).
