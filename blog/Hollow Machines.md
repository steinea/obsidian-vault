# Hollow Machines

[[2019]] / [[Blog]]

*Hollow Machines* is a simple, semi-complete game about armour and positionality. It builds on some of the ideas put forward in my [*Affinity*](https://vagrantludology.itch.io/affinity-dream) plugin.

Get three friends, pick your suit of armour, and place a deck of cards face down on a table between you. Draw to find out what happens.

This game was made for the [Open Access Met Jam](https://itch.io/jam/met-jam) and features content pulled from the online [open access collections](https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search#!?searchField=All&showOnly=openAccess&sortBy=relevance&offset=0&pageSize=0) of the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
