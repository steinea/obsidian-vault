[[2020]] / [[Blog]]

This is a critique of legal singularity, a work of sabotage, a speculative improvisation. It is not a game. It is a plan.

The pdf is printable as a half-letter or A5 booklet. The font is [Atkinson Hyperlegible](https://www.brailleinstitute.org/freefont). The cover image is "Luddites smashing a power loom in 1812," in the public domain from [Wikimedia Commons](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:FrameBreaking-1812.jpg).
