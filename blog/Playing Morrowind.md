[[2022]] / [[Blog]]

On a whim, I got *[[The Elder Scrolls III Morrowind]]* up and running on my PC and spent the last few days playing through the opening zone of the game, [Seyda Neen](https://en.m.uesp.net/wiki/Morrowind:Seyda_Neen). The last time I played Morrowind was shortly before *The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion* came out, which was 2006. It's been a while. I own the game of the year addition through GOG, and most of the effort was put into getting it to display correctly on my 1440p monitor. Aurelie's [Wrye Mash Guide](https://danaeplays.thenet.sk/wrye-mash/) was extremely helpful. To summarize the process, you just need three pieces of software: the [[Wrye Mash Polemos Fork]], [[MLOX]], and [[tes3cmd]]. Following the guide, I was able to easily install a few mods: the [[Morrowind Code Patch]], [[Morrowind Graphics Extender XE]], [[Morrowind Enhanced Textures]], [[UI Expansion]], and [[Better Dialogue Font]]. Some of them install directly, and some through the Wrye Mash interface. Nothing too complicated. I didn't want to change the game dramatically, but rather just make it playable at higher resolution. So far, so good. I'm having a great time.
