"A publication of green anarchist art, poetry, stories, rants from 'so called-Australia.' We are in a new epoch of breakdown. What will it mean to not have a horizon ... to have no map of how to act ... to have only shifting sands to cling to and be in a world radically different than that of the last 10000+ years? What does green anarchy mean today."
